Assignment:

We sell three products, {Apples, Bananas, Carrots}, and we have one farm that can produce any amount of the products at the given prices:

Apples                  $2.00 ea

Bananas               $1.50 ea

Carrots                 $3.00 for 3 Carrots â€“ must be bought in 3s 

(ex: if a customer wants 5, we will need to buy 6)

 

With this in mind, come up with a program that will take in orders, and output the total order cost.
